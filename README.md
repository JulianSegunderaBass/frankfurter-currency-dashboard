### A Browsing App for Currency Exchange Rates using the [Frankfurter Currency API](https://www.frankfurter.app/)

I used this project to practice working with React components and context. You may select from the list of available API currencies and compare exchange rates from one root currency value.

Please feel free to mention any improvements or bugs you may find. :)
